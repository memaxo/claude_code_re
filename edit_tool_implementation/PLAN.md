# Edit Tool Implementation Plan

## Overview

Based on the analysis of the Claude Code's `EditTool` implementation, I'll create a standalone version of the Edit tool that can:
1. Replace text in files
2. Create new files
3. Handle whitespace and special characters appropriately
4. Validate changes before applying them
5. Provide appropriate error handling

## Key Components

### 1. EditTool Object

The main `EditTool` object with these properties and methods:
- `name`: The name of the tool ("Edit")
- `description()`: Returns a description of the tool
- `isEnabled()`: Checks if the tool is available
- `inputSchema`: Schema for validating inputs
- `checkPermissions()`: Validates permissions to edit files
- `call()`: Main function that performs the edit
- Rendering methods for UI components

### 2. Input Preprocessing

A dedicated function (`preprocessEditToolInput`) that:
- Handles character replacements for consistent behavior
- Normalizes line endings
- Ensures exact matching for replacements

### 3. File Operations

Functions for:
- Reading file content
- Performing text replacements
- Creating new files
- Writing changes back to disk

### 4. Validation Logic

Code to ensure:
- File paths are absolute
- Replacement strings match exactly
- Expected replacements match actual replacements
- Proper error messages for validation failures

### 5. Error Handling

Robust error handling for:
- File not found
- Permission denied
- Failed validations
- Incorrect replacement counts

## Implementation Files

1. `edit_tool.js`: Main implementation of the Edit tool
2. `utils.js`: Helper utilities for file operations and validation
3. `schema.js`: Validation schema and related functions
4. `edit_tool_demo.js`: Simple demo showing the Edit tool in action

## Implementation Approach

1. Start with core file operations (read/write)
2. Implement the preprocessing logic for string replacements
3. Create the validation functions
4. Build the main EditTool object with its methods
5. Add comprehensive error handling
6. Create a simple demo to demonstrate functionality

Let's begin with the implementation in these steps.
