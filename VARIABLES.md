## Note on Naming Patterns

The variable naming follows typical minification patterns:
- Single letters (I, Z, G, W) for common function parameters
- Short character sequences with numbers (xP, _0, I9) for module-level variables
- Longer names with numbers (jW1, RT1, Ub5) for exported functions/objects
- Command handlers tend to use `process.exit(0)` to terminate after execution
- UI components have React patterns (useState, useEffect, memo)
