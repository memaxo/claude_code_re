# Comprehensive Plan for Claude Code CLI Reverse Engineering

## Phase 1: Initial Static Analysis ‚úÖ
- [x] Target: `cli.js` (8.21MB, 261,649 lines of minified JavaScript)
- [x] Identify key components (API clients, tools, command processing)
- [x] Map minified variable names to likely purposes in VARIABLES.md
- [x] Document architecture and patterns in FINDINGS.md
- [x] Analyze code snippets in CODE_ANALYSIS.md
- [x] Create initial renaming map in REPLACE.md
- [x] Create renaming script (rename_identifiers.py)
- [x] Generate first renamed version (cli_renamed.js)

## Phase 2: Progressive Renaming & Deeper Analysis üîÑ

### 2.1 Message Flow Analysis ‚úÖ
- [x] Identify and rename message-related functions and variables
  - Identified `formatMessages`, `Gn5`, `Wn5`, `generateMetadata`, etc.
  - Examined message formatting and handling for API communication
- [x] Document message structure and flow in CODE_ANALYSIS.md
  - Added sections on message formatting, API streaming, and token counting
- [x] Create visualization of message lifecycle
  - Documented the 5-step message lifecycle in FINDINGS.md

### 2.2 Tool System Expansion
- [ ] Identify additional tool-related variables beyond primary set
  - Tool registration, discovery, and management functions
  - Tool permission checking and execution context
  - Tool result processing and rendering
- [ ] Map relationships between tool objects and UI components
- [ ] Document complete tool lifecycle in FINDINGS.md

### 2.3 UI Component Analysis
- [ ] Identify React/Ink components beyond nr5 (ReplInterface)
  - Find state hooks and event handlers
  - Look for UI rendering and styling functions
  - Map relationships between components
- [ ] Create component hierarchy documentation
- [ ] Rename UI-related functions and variables

### 2.4 Command Processing Expansion
- [ ] Identify remaining command handlers
  - Find commander.js command registration and execution
  - Map CLI flags to handlers
  - Identify session management code
- [ ] Document command processing pipeline
- [ ] Rename command-related functions and variables

### 2.5 Configuration and Environment
- [ ] Identify configuration loading and validation functions
  - Look for environment variable handling
  - Find config file parsing logic
  - Identify feature flags and toggles
- [ ] Document configuration schema
- [ ] Rename configuration-related functions and variables

## Phase 3: Iterative Renaming Process üîÑ

For each of the above areas, follow this process:

1. **Extension Analysis**
   - Examine cli_renamed.js to find related minified identifiers
   - Focus on functions that call or are called by already-renamed functions
   - Use context to determine purpose

2. **Context-Based Identification**
   - For each new function/variable, collect 5-10 lines of context
   - Analyze parameters, return values, and usage patterns
   - Assign probable meaning based on context

3. **Mapping Update**
   - Create new entries in the renaming map
   - Assign descriptive names based on function/variable purpose
   - Document reasoning in VARIABLES.md

4. **Apply & Verify**
   - Update rename_identifiers.py with new mappings
   - Generate updated renamed version
   - Verify correctness through code inspection

5. **Repeat** until diminishing returns are reached

## Phase 4: Synthetic Documentation üìö

### 4.1 Function Documentation
- [ ] Create function signature documentation for key functions
- [ ] Document parameters, return values, and side effects
- [ ] Group related functions by subsystem

### 4.2 Module Structure
- [ ] Identify logical "modules" within the codebase
- [ ] Create module dependency graph
- [ ] Document module interfaces and responsibilities

### 4.3 Architecture Diagrams
- [ ] Create high-level architecture diagram
- [ ] Generate component interaction diagrams
- [ ] Document data flow between components

## Phase 5: Advanced Analysis ‚öôÔ∏è

### 5.1 Control Flow Analysis
- [ ] Identify entry points and execution paths
- [ ] Map conditional branches and decision points
- [ ] Document error handling and recovery mechanisms

### 5.2 State Management
- [ ] Identify global and component state
- [ ] Document state transitions and side effects
- [ ] Map relationships between state variables

### 5.3 Security Analysis
- [ ] Analyze credential handling in depth
- [ ] Review permission models and access control
- [ ] Identify potential vulnerabilities

## Tools & Methods

### Pattern Identification
- Use grep patterns with broader context (-C 10)
- Search for calls to/from renamed functions
- Look for distinctive string literals and error messages

### Renaming Strategy
- Focus on "hub" functions first (called by many other functions)
- Prioritize functions that appear in execution hot paths
- Use consistent naming conventions (same prefix for related functions)

### Script Enhancements
- Enhance rename_identifiers.py to detect related functions
- Add support for interactive renaming suggestions
- Implement "confidence scoring" for suggested names

### Documentation Generation
- Create scripts to auto-generate function documentation
- Use call graphs to visualize relationships
- Maintain cross-references between code and documentation files

## Success Criteria

- 80%+ of significant functions renamed with meaningful names
- Complete message flow documentation
- Full tool system architecture documentation
- Component hierarchy and relationships mapped
- Entry points and execution paths identified

The end goal is not just a renamed codebase, but a comprehensive understanding of the Claude Code CLI architecture, components, and behavior that could theoretically enable reimplementation or extension.
