  - renderToolResultMessage: UI display function

## Phase 3: Parser-Based Analysis üîÑ

Using a JavaScript parser (Acorn) and dedicated analysis scripts to overcome the limitations of pattern matching and gain deeper structural insights:

- [x] **Setup Parser Environment**
  - Installed necessary Node.js packages (`acorn`, `estraverse`)
  - Created `ast_parser.js` to parse `cli.js` into an AST (handling shebang, module/script fallback)
  - Implemented utilities to traverse and analyze the AST
  - Added robust JSON output handling (`safeWrite`)
- [x] **Perform Scope Analysis**
  - Implemented `scope_analyzer.js` to process AST output
  - Generated `scope_report.md` listing global and multi-scope variables
- [x] **Function Control Flow Analysis**
  - Implemented `flow_analyzer.js` to analyze specific key functions
  - Generated individual markdown reports (`flow_reports/`) for analyzed functions
- [x] **Call Graph Construction**
  - Integrated call graph building into `ast_parser.js`
  - Generated filtered `call_graph.json` output
- [x] **Structural Pattern Matching**
  - Integrated identification of function declarations and potential tool objects into `ast_parser.js`
  - Generated filtered `functions.json` and `tool_objects.json`

**Next Steps Using AST Data:**

- [ ] **Integrate Scope Analysis into Renaming (üöß Highest Priority)**
  - Review `scope_report.md` for multi-scope variables
  - Update `REPLACE.md`/`VARIABLES.md` to mark ambiguous variables
  - **Modify `rename_identifiers.py` to exclude multi-scope variables from automatic replacement**
  - Generate safer `cli_renamed_v2.js`
- [ ] **Validate Renames with Call Graph & Control Flow (üöß)**
  - Examine `call_graph.json` and `flow_reports/`
  - Verify connections between renamed functions
  - Use call graph/control flow to discover/confirm purpose of other functions
- [ ] **Refine Tool Identification (üöß)**
  - Filter `tool_objects.json` using stricter criteria (presence of `name`, `call`, `inputSchema`)
  - Update `FINDINGS.md`/`CODE_ANALYSIS.md` with accurate tool list
  - **Note:** AST analysis of object literals with `name` proved insufficient; relying on `primaryTools` array and `executeToolCall` context is more reliable.

- [ ] **Advanced Schema-Based Identification** (Future)
  - Use AST to extract schema information
  - Match schema structures to identify tool definitions
  - Extract validation rules from schemas
  - Document the complete schema hierarchy

## Phase 4: Synthetic Documentation üìö

### 4.1 Function Documentation
- [ ] Create function signature documentation for key functions
- [ ] Document parameters, return values, and side effects
- [ ] Group related functions by subsystem

### 4.2 Module Structure
- [ ] Identify logical "modules" within the codebase
- [ ] Create module dependency graph
- [ ] Document module interfaces and responsibilities

### 4.3 Architecture Diagrams
- [ ] Create high-level architecture diagram
- [ ] Generate component interaction diagrams
- [ ] Document data flow between components

## Phase 5: Advanced Analysis ‚öôÔ∏è

### 5.1 Control Flow Analysis
- [ ] Identify entry points and execution paths
- [ ] Map conditional branches and decision points
- [ ] Document error handling and recovery mechanisms

### 5.2 State Management
- [ ] Identify global and component state
- [ ] Document state transitions and side effects
- [ ] Map relationships between state variables

### 5.3 Security Analysis
- [ ] Analyze credential handling in depth
- [ ] Review permission models and access control
- [ ] Identify potential vulnerabilities

## Tools & Methods

### Pattern Identification
- Use grep patterns with broader context (-C 10)
- Search for calls to/from renamed functions
- Look for distinctive string literals and error messages

### Renaming Strategy
- Focus on "hub" functions first (called by many other functions)
- Prioritize functions that appear in execution hot paths
- Use consistent naming conventions (same prefix for related functions)

### Script Enhancements
- Enhance rename_identifiers.py to detect related functions
- Add support for interactive renaming suggestions
- Implement "confidence scoring" for suggested names

### Documentation Generation
- Create scripts to auto-generate function documentation
- Use call graphs to visualize relationships
- Maintain cross-references between code and documentation files

## Success Criteria

- 80%+ of significant functions renamed with meaningful names
- Complete message flow documentation
- Full tool system architecture documentation
- Component hierarchy and relationships mapped
- Entry points and execution paths identified

The end goal is not just a renamed codebase, but a comprehensive understanding of the Claude Code CLI architecture, components, and behavior that could theoretically enable reimplementation or extension.
